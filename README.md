# testyourownapp

Created my own simple app to write tests against so as to not spam websites while demonstrating that I can write tests that navigate pages and fill forms.

Pre-requisites: node/npm


To start web server:
- cd testingsite
- npm install
- npm start

To test: 
- cd acceptance_tests
- npm install
- npm test
